    "aiHeadline": "In a shocking turn of events, someone actually used their engineering skills for good and designed an espresso machine and coffee grinder that doesn't look like it was built by a time-traveling Victorian, because who needs sleep when you can have a perfectly brewed cup of coffee to fuel your late-night coding sessions, am I right?"
